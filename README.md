# GMC-analysis
This is a code to display a few graphs for galaxies NGC 1672, NGC 3351, NGC 3627, NGC 4254, NGC 4303, NGC 4321, NGC 4535, NGC 5068, and NGC 6744. The plots will compare virial mass to luminous mass (in solar units), luminous mass to radius (in parsecs), and linewidth (in km/s) to radius. All of these are plotted on log-log scales.
